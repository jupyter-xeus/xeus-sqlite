**xeus-sqlite is and early developer preview and is not suitable for general usage yet. Features and implementation are subject to change.**

`xeus-sqlite` is a Jupyter kernel for SQL based on the native implementation of the Jupyter protocol [xeus](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus).

## Usage

Launch the Jupyter notebook with `jupyter notebook` or Jupyter lab with `jupyter lab` and launch a new SQL notebook by selecting the **xsqlite** kernel.

## Installation

Currently, only installation from source is available.

To ensure that the installation works, it is preferable to install `xeus` in a fresh conda environment. It is also needed to use
a [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) installation because with the full [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
you may have a conflict.

The safest usage is to create an environment named `xeus-sqlite-env` within your miniconda installation

```bash
conda create -n xeus-sqlite-env
conda activate xeus-sqlite-env
conda install cmake nlohmann_json xtl cppzmq xeus sqlite sqlitecpp cpp-tabulate -c conda-forge
```

Once you have installed the depndencies, the `xeus-sqlite` project is quite easy to install, you have to clone the repository,
and run the following command lines:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$CONDA_PREFIX ..
make
make install
```
